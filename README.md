### Overview

This repository contains the code for a Python application, structured into two main files: `app.py` and `main.py`. The dependencies required to run this application are listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Files

- **app.py**: This file likely contains the core logic and functionalities of the application, such as defining routes, handling requests, or processing data.
- **main.py**: This file probably serves as the entry point for the application, initializing the application, setting configurations, and starting the server or main process.
- **requirements.txt**: This file lists all the Python packages and dependencies needed to run the application, ensuring that the environment is properly set up.

### Setup

To set up the application, install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, run the application using:

```bash
python main.py
```
